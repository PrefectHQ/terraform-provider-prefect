# When importing an existing Webhook resource

# Terraform's `file()` input does not perform any encoding
# to normalize the input. If this is a problem for you, you
# can wrap the file input in a jsonencode/jsondecode call:

# For dynamic webhook templates where the desired payload should be
# in JSON format, use the heredoc format to ensure the expression
# is preserved.
#
# As an example, this webhook could be called via curl:
#
# ```bash
# curl -X POST "${url}" \
#   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#   -d '{
#     "foo": "foo",
#     "bar": "bar"
#   }'
