# prefect_resource_sla (Resource)

The resource 'resource_sla' represents a Prefect Resource SLA.
<br>
For more information, see documentation on setting up [Service Level Agreements](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/automate/events/slas) on Prefect resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "prefect_flow" "my_flow" {
  name = "my-flow"
}

resource "prefect_deployment" "my_deployment" {
  name    = "my-deployment"
  flow_id = prefect_flow.my_flow.id
}

resource "prefect_resource_sla" "test_json_payload" {
  resource_id = "prefect.deployment.${prefect_deployment.my_deployment.id}"
  slas = [
    {
      name = "my-time-to-completion" # can be any string
      # severity = "high" # the default value
      duration = 60 # Max flow run duration in seconds before SLA is violated
    },
    {
      name        = "my-frequency"
      severity    = "critical"
      stale_after = 60 # Amount of time in seconds after a flow run is considered stale
    },
    {
      name           = "my-freshness"
      severity       = "moderate"
      within         = 60 # The amount of time after a flow run is considered stale.
      resource_match = {}
      expected_event = "my-event"
    },
    {
      name     = "my-lateness"
      severity = "moderate"
      within   = 60 # The amount of time after a flow run is considered stale.
    }
  ]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `resource_id` (String) The ID of the Prefect resource to set the SLA for, in the format of `prefect.<resource_type>.<resource_id>`.
- `slas` (Attributes List) List of SLAs to set for the resource. Note that this is a declarative list, and any SLAs that are not defined in this list will be removed from the resource (if they existed previously). Existing SLAs will be updated to match the definitions in this list. See documentation on [Defining SLAs](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/automate/events/slas#defining-slas) for more information, as well as the [API specification](https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs#tag/SLAs/operation/apply_slas_api_accounts__account_id__workspaces__workspace_id__slas_apply_resource_slas__resource_id__post) for the SLA payload structure. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--slas))

### Optional

- `account_id` (String) Account ID (UUID), defaults to the account set in the provider
- `workspace_id` (String) Workspace ID (UUID), defaults to the workspace set in the provider

### Nested Schema for `slas`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the SLA

Optional:

- `duration` (Number) (Freshness SLA) Duration of the SLA in seconds
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the SLA is enabled
- `expected_event` (String) (Freshness SLA) Event expected to occur within the SLA window
- `owner_resource` (String) Resource that owns this SLA
- `resource_match` (String) (Freshness SLA) Resource specification labels which this SLA will match. Use `jsonencode()`
- `severity` (String) Severity level of the SLA. Can be one of `minor`, `low`, `moderate`, `high`, or `critical`.
- `stale_after` (Number) (Frequency SLA) Time in seconds after which the SLA is considered stale
- `within` (Number) (Freshness SLA or Lateness SLA) Time window in seconds for the SLA
