# prefect_flow (Resource)

The resource `flow` represents a Prefect Flow. Flows are the most central Prefect object. A flow is a container for workflow logic as-code and allows users to configure how their workflows behave. Flows are defined as Python functions, and any Python function is eligible to be a flow. For more information, see [write and run flows](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/develop/write-flows).

This feature is available in the following [product plan(s)](https://www.prefect.io/pricing): Prefect OSS, Prefect Cloud (Free), Prefect Cloud (Pro), Prefect Cloud (Enterprise).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "prefect_workspace" "workspace" {
  handle = "my-workspace"
  name   = "my-workspace"
}

resource "prefect_flow" "flow" {
  name         = "my-flow"
  workspace_id = prefect_workspace.workspace.id
  tags         = ["tf-test"]
}
```

terraform import prefect_flow.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

# or from a different workspace via flow_id,workspace_id
terraform import prefect_flow.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
