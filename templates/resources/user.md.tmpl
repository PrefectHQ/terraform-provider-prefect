{{.Description}}

A User is an individual user of Prefect Cloud. Use this resource to manage a
user's profile information. You can also use this resource to assign membership
to resources like Teams and Workspaces. For more information, see
[manage users](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/manage/cloud/manage-users/users).

There are two important caveats with this resource.

First, **users cannot be created** because this is not supported by the API due
to the way invitations work. Instead, you must first import user resources into
the state before they can be managed.

Second, the `user` resource requires that the API key used in the Prefect
provider be generated by the same user you are importing. This is because the
User API includes validation to confirm that requests for a user can only be
made by the user itself.

If you do not need to manage the attributes of a user, and only need to
retrieve the user ID for reference in other resources, consider using the
[account member datasource](./docs/data-sources/account_member.md) instead.
