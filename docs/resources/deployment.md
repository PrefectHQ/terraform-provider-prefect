# prefect_deployment (Resource)


Deployments are server-side representations of flows. They store the crucial metadata needed for remote orchestration including when, where, and how a workflow should run. Deployments elevate workflows from functions that you must call manually to API-managed entities that can be triggered remotely. For more information, see [deploy overview](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/deploy/index).

This feature is available in the following [product plan(s)](https://www.prefect.io/pricing): Prefect OSS, Hobby, Starter, Team, Pro, Enterprise.


## Example Usage

```terraform

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Prefect Deployments can be imported via deployment_id
terraform import prefect_deployment.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

# or from a different workspace via deployment_id,workspace_id
terraform import prefect_deployment.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

## Deployment actions

The deployment resource does not provide any direct equivalent to the
[`build`](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/prefect-yaml#the-build-action)
and [`push`](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/prefect-yaml#the-push-action)
actions available in the `prefect.yaml`
approach used with the Prefect CLI.

However, you can specify an image in the `job_variables` field:

```terraform
resource "prefect_deployment" "deployment" {
  name                     = "my-deployment"
  description              = "my description"
  flow_id                  = prefect_flow.flow.id

  job_variables = jsonencode({
    "image" : "example.registry.com/example-repo/example-image:v1" }
  })
}
```

This setting controls the image used in the Kubernetes Job that executes the flow.

Additionally, a provider such as [kreuzwerker/docker](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest/docs)
may be useful if you still need to build and push images from Terraform. Otherwise,
we recommend using another mechanism to build and push images and then refer to
them by name as shown in the example above. Notably, Hashicorp also makes
Packer, which can [build Docker images](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/docker-get-started/docker-get-started-build-image).
