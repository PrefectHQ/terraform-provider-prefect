# prefect_work_queue (Resource)

The resource `work_queue` represents a Prefect Work Queue. Work Queues are used to configure and manage job execution queues in Prefect.

Work Queues can be associated with a work pool and have configurations like concurrency limits.

For more information, see [work queues](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/work-pools#work-queues).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "prefect_workspace" "example" {
  handle = "my-workspace"
  name   = "my-workspace"
}

resource "prefect_work_pool" "example" {
  name         = "my-work-pool"
  type         = "kubernetes"
  paused       = false
  workspace_id = prefect_workspace.example.id
}

resource "prefect_work_queue" "example" {
  name              = "my-work-queue"
  description       = "My work queue"
  concurrency_limit = 2
  workspace_id      = prefect_workspace.example.id
}
