# prefect_deployment (Resource)

Deployments are server-side representations of flows. They store the crucial metadata needed for remote orchestration including when, where, and how a workflow should run. Deployments elevate workflows from functions that you must call manually to API-managed entities that can be triggered remotely.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "prefect_workspace" "workspace" {
  handle = "my-workspace"
  name   = "my-workspace"
}

resource "prefect_flow" "flow" {
  name         = "my-flow"
  workspace_id = prefect_workspace.workspace.id
  tags         = ["tf-test"]
}

resource "prefect_deployment" "deployment" {
  name                     = "my-deployment"
  description              = "string"
  workspace_id             = prefect_workspace.workspace.id
  flow_id                  = prefect_flow.flow.id
  entrypoint               = "hello_world.py:hello_world"
  tags                     = ["test"]
  enforce_parameter_schema = false
  manifest_path            = "./bar/foo"
  path                     = "./foo/bar"
  paused                   = false
  version                  = "v1.1.1"
  work_pool_name           = "mitch-testing-pool"
  work_queue_name          = "default"
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell

terraform import prefect_deployment.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

# or via deployment_id,workspace_id
terraform import prefect_deployment.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
