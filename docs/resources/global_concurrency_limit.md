# prefect_global_concurrency_limit (Resource)

The resource `global_concurrency_limit` represents a global concurrency limit. Global concurrency limits allow you to control how many tasks can run simultaneously across all workspaces. For more information, see [apply global concurrency and rate limits](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/develop/global-concurrency-limits).

This feature is available in the following product plans: Prefect Cloud (Free), Prefect Cloud (Pro), Prefect Cloud (Enterprise), Prefect OSS.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "prefect" {}

data "prefect_workspace" "test" {
  handle = "my-workspace"
}

resource "prefect_global_concurrency_limit" "test" {
  workspace_id          = data.prefect_workspace.test.id
  name                  = "test-global-concurrency-limit"
  limit                 = 1
  active                = true
  active_slots          = 0
  slot_decay_per_second = 1.5
}
```
