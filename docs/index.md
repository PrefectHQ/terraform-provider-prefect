# Prefect Provider

Use the [Prefect](https://prefect.io) provider to configure your Prefect infrastructure.

See [getting started](./guides/getting-started.md) for more information on setting up the provider.

See [troubleshoting](./guides/troubleshooting.md) for resources to address potential errors.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    prefect = {
      source = "prefecthq/prefect"
    }
  }
}

# By default, the provider points to Prefect Cloud
# and you can pass in your API key and account ID
# via variables or static inputs.
provider "prefect" {
  api_key    = var.prefect_api_key
  account_id = var.prefect_account_id
}

# You can also pass in your API key and account ID
# implicitly via environment variables, such as
# PREFECT_API_KEY and PREFECT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID.
provider "prefect" {}

# You also have the option to link the provider instance
# to your specific workspace, if this fits your use case.
provider "prefect" {
  api_key      = var.prefect_api_key
  account_id   = var.prefect_account_id
  workspace_id = var.prefect_workspace_id
}

# You also have the option to specify the account and workspace
# in the `endpoint` attribute. This is the same format used for
# the `PREFECT_API_KEY` value used in the Prefect CLI configuration file.
provider "prefect" {
  endpoint = "https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/workspaces/22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"
}

# Finally, in rare occasions, you also have the option
# to point the provider to a locally running Prefect Server,
# with a limited set of functionality from the provider.
provider "prefect" {
  endpoint = "http://localhost:4200"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `account_id` (String) Default Prefect Cloud Account ID. Can also be set via the `PREFECT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable.
- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) Prefect Cloud API key. Can also be set via the `PREFECT_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `basic_auth_key` (String, Sensitive) Prefect basic auth key. Can also be set via the `PREFECT_BASIC_AUTH_KEY` environment variable.
- `endpoint` (String) The Prefect API URL. Can also be set via the `PREFECT_API_URL` environment variable. Defaults to `https://api.prefect.cloud` if not configured. Can optionally include the default account ID and workspace ID in the following format: `https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/<accountID>/workspaces/<workspaceID>`. This is the same format used for the `PREFECT_API_URL` value in the Prefect CLI configuration file. The `account_id` and `workspace_id` attributes and their matching environment variables will take priority over any account and workspace ID values provided in the `endpoint` attribute.
- `workspace_id` (String) Default Prefect Cloud Workspace ID.
