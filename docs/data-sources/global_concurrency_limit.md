# prefect_global_concurrency_limit (Data Source)

Get information about an existing Global Concurrency Limit
<br>
Use this data source to read down the pre-defined Global Concurrency Limits, to manage concurrency limits.

For more information, see [apply global concurrency and rate limits](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/develop/global-concurrency-limits).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "prefect_global_concurrency_limit" "limit_by_id" {
  id           = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}

data "prefect_global_concurrency_limit" "limit_by_name" {
  name         = "my-limit"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
