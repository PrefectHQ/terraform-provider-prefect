Flows are defined as Python functions, and any Python function is eligible to be a flow. For more information, see [write and run flows](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/develop/write-flows).

This feature is available in the following product tiers: Prefect Cloud (free), Prefect Cloud (paid), Prefect OSS.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "prefect_workspace" "workspace" {
  handle = "my-workspace"
  name   = "my-workspace"
}

resource "prefect_flow" "flow" {
  name         = "my-flow"
  workspace_id = prefect_workspace.workspace.id
