# prefect_service_account (Resource)

The resource `service_account` represents a Prefect Cloud Service Account. A Service Account allows you to create an API Key that is not associated with a user account.

Service Accounts are used to configure API access for workers or programs. Use this resource to provision and rotate Keys as well as assign Account and Workspace Access through Roles.

API Keys for `service_account` resources can be rotated by modifying the `api_key_expiration` attribute.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# NON-EXPIRING API KEY
resource "prefect_service_account" "example" {
  name = "my-service-account"
}

# ROTATING API KEY
# Use the hashicorp/time provider to generate a time_rotating resource
provider "time" {}
resource "time_rotating" "ninety_days" {
  rotation_days = 90
}
# Pass the time_rotating resource to the `api_key_expiration` attribute
# in order to automate the rotation of the Service Account key
resource "prefect_service_account" "example" {
  name               = "my-service-account"
  api_key_expiration = time_rotating.ninety_days.rotation_rfc3339
}
```
