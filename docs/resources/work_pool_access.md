# All work pools are scoped to a Workspace.
data "prefect_workspace" "test" {
  handle = "my-workspace"

  name = "my-service-account"
}

resource "prefect_workspace_access" "test" {
  accessor_type     = "SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
  accessor_id       = prefect_service_account.test.id
  workspace_role_id = data.prefect_workspace_role.developer.id
  workspace_id      = data.prefect_workspace.test.id
}


# Example: invite a Team to the Workspace and grant it Developer access
