# prefect_work_pool (Resource)

The resource `work_pool` represents a Prefect Cloud Work Pool. Work Pools represent infrastructure configurations for jobs across several common environments.

Work Pools can be set up with default base job configurations, based on which type. Use this in conjunction with the `prefect_worker_metadata` data source to bootstrap new Work Pools quickly.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "prefect_work_pool" "example" {
  name         = "my-work-pool"
  type         = "kubernetes"
  paused       = false
  workspace_id = "my-workspace-id"
}

# Use a JSON file to load a base job configuration
resource "prefect_work_pool" "example" {
  name              = "test-k8s-pool"
  type              = "kubernetes"
  workspace_id      = data.prefect_workspace.prd.id
  paused            = false
  base_job_template = file("./base-job-template.json")
}

# Or use the prefect_worker_metadata datasource
# to load a default base job configuration
data "prefect_worker_metadata" "d" {}

resource "prefect_work_pool" "example" {
  name              = "test-k8s-pool"
  type              = "kubernetes"
  workspace_id      = data.prefect_workspace.prd.id
  paused            = false
  base_job_template = data.prefect_worker_metadata.d.base_job_configs.kubernetes
}
```
