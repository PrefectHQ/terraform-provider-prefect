# prefect_flow (Resource)

The resource `flow` represents a Prefect Cloud Flow. Flows are the most central Prefect object. A flow is a container for workflow logic as-code and allows users to configure how their workflows behave. Flows are defined as Python functions, and any Python function is eligible to be a flow.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "prefect_workspace" "workspace" {
	handle = "my-workspace"
	name = "my-workspace"
}

resource "prefect_flow" "flow" {
	name = "my-flow"
	workspace_id = prefect_workspace.workspace.id
	tags = ["tf-test"]
}
```
